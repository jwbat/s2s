One of the friends channeled the message that Monica would be using her gifts of sound to assist others on their spiritual path. Monica has been working with music and sound for decades. She began singing performances from the age of 8 and went on to become a singer/songwriter throughout her 20’s and 30’s. She is a level 3 practitioner of Dolores Cannon’s, QHHT(Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique). Her work in the healing arts, along with her background in music were the perfect pairing to bring healing through vibrational sound. Each session is unique to the individual or group, depending on how the energy wants to flow in at that time. </p><h4 data-v-a1898bbd> Schedule a session </h4><p data-v-a1898bbd> You may schedule an in person, one-on-one session with Monica by clicking the calendar link below. </p><a href="https://calendly.com/monicadunnqhht/sound-attunement" class="cta-link" data-v-a1898bbd>Schedule a Sound Attunement</a><p data-v-a1898bbd> If you are interested in scheduling a group Sacred Soul Sounds attunement, or have questions please contact Monica via email. </p>',10),m={__name:"index",setup(e){const n=c();return(f,v)=>(i(),o("div",l,[b,a("img",{src:`${t(n).app.baseURL}logo.jpg`,alt:"Logo"},null,8,p),g]))}},w=h(m,[["__scopeId","data-v-a1898bbd"]]);export{w as default};
